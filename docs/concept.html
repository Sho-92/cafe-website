          <h2>The essence of Japanese café culture captured in a cup of coffee.</h2>
          <p>The term "kissa" originally referred to the practice and etiquette of enjoying tea, a tradition that was brought from China during the Kamakura period. In the later-developed tea ceremony, the most important aspect is the spirit of hospitality towards guests, creating a unique and special experience in the tea room. At KISSA, we aim to infuse this rich cultural heritage of tea into the coffee culture, providing our customers with a special moment to cherish.</p>
